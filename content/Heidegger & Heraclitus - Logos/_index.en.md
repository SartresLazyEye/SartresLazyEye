### Motivations for Paper


On Heidegger's Book `Ontology-On the Hermeneutics of Facticity` he establishes a framework under which Being can be understood. To break down the title, **Ontology** simply refers to *the questioning and defining which is directed to beings as such*. Heidegger states that this understanding of Ontology must be understood within the framework of classic Greek philosophy, which is fundamentally removed from how modern ontology is practiced.

#### Modern vs. Greek Ontology

##### Modern Ontology and the practice of phenomenology

In modern Ontology, the theme is strictly narrowed to *being-an-object* (i.e., the objectivity of definite objects). This is problematic to Heidegger because the being of the object becomes visible strictly by looking into the consciousness of the object. Within this framework, being is reduced into subject (i.e., who is evaluating the being of an object) and the object (the being that is being investigated). This process is is typically referred to as phenomenology.

Therefore, in modern ontology, we try to extrapolate the being of an object through analysis. However, this is far removed from how the Greeks approached ontology.

##### Greek Ontology and the practice of phenomology

If phenomenology is going to be utilized as a way to understand the being of things, the Greek sense of the term may be more appropriate. The Greek word phenomenon (i.e., φαινόμενον) translates to "thing appearing into view". Thus, it is something that shows itself, or "being-present" as an object. 

In this framework, instead of phenomenology being understood as the subject being Dasein analyzing and extrapolating the ontic characteristics of a thing. You should view it as the process of how the subject (e.g., the thing you are analyzing) show itself to Dasein.

#### Heidegger: Adopting a Greek Conception of Phenomenology

In the first few sections of Heidegger's Plato's Sophist, he highlights how the Greek lexicon allows for a fundamentally different conception of truth. For example, in modern romantic and anglo languages, truth is understood as a "positive assertion"--something that makes itself present. We percieve truth as something that is self-evident and prominent. Thus, truth is something we can attain and posses; and not having truth is simply a lack of truth thereof.

However, truth in Ancient Greek is understood as ἀλήθεια. Note the etymology. 

ἀ - is referred to a lack thereof, or not. 

λήθεια, which has the Greek root, λήθω, could possibly be translated as "To escape notice, To remain in hiding". To dive deeper into the language, the river of forgetting in Greek, is derived from this term, λήθη, which means "oblivion", "forgetfulness", and "concealment".

In this regard, the normal state of untruth, is not conceived as a lack of truth, but simply possessing a fundamental misunderstanding of things that hide their essence. With this being the assumption, what is the next step to understanding the truth of things? the being of things? Heidegger uses the Greek word, λόγος as a guide for how Dasein ought to understand Being.

##### How has λόγος been understood in the modern western tradition? 

In Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle defines human to be  ζῷον λόγον ἔχον, which throughout the european tradition through the likes of Philosophers such as Descartes came to be understood as “Human is a rational Animal”.

Within this framework, western philosophers such as Descartes came to interpret this as a capacity to reason and engage in logical reasoning and derivation of truths. However, this may be a little misleading, for λόγος does not explicitly describe people who are reasonable, or unreasonable. What is it conceived as then?

##### How has λόγος been understood in the ancient Greek tradition? 

Aristotle in Nichomachean ethics argues that λόγος is to be seen as a universal human feature, the definition applied to wise and foolish alike, and did not in any way imply necessarily the making of rational choices

In fact, when we break down the Greek, ζῷον λόγον ἔχον could be understood simply as a "an animal that posses the ability to utilize λόγος". To conceptualize this phenomenon, Heidegger emphasizes that humans are possessors of λόγος, means that with λόγος humans can engage in discourse through his immediate being-in-the-world (S6, Ontology)




To raise the question of aletheia, of disclosure as such, is not the same as raising the question of truth. For this reason, it was inadequate and misleading to call aletheia, in the sense of opening, truth."





















Heraclitus fragements: 17. They know neither how to listen or how to speak. (fr. 19)


23. Having listened not to me but to the Logos, it is wise to agree that all
are one. (fr. 50)


30. You could not in your going find the ends of the soul, though you
traveled the whole way; so deep is its Logos. (fr. 45)

The existing universal law [the Logos] notwithstanding, people are
forever without understanding, both before they hear it and having heard
it for the first time. For although everything happens in accordance with
this principle, people seem unacquainted with it, although they experience both word and deed of the kind of thing that I myself set out in
Heraclitus 81
detail, distinguishing each thing according to its nature and showing how
each thing is. But what other people do escapes them, just as they let
escape them what they do while asleep. (fr. 1)
